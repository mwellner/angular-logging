# Logging

This project demonstrates the usage of `ngx-logger`.

## Development server

Run `npm run start-server` to launch a simple json-server at localhost:3000. Error logs will be stored there, can be seen in `src/db/db.json` or at `localhost://localhost:3000/logs`.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
